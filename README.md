This software generates 8-bit sound effects by an evolutionary process. You will be the one to steer the evolution towards the sound you desire to create.

12 different sound effects will be presented to you for evaluation and is the core of the evolutionary process. Select the ones you prefer by clicking on them and finally pressing the evolve button when ready (click on them again to deselect). The system will then create new candidates and evolve them towards your preferences with some variation.

To assist you in the process, there are several buttons on the interface which include: save, load, play, pause, reset, retry, next, prev, mutation rate, mutation size, status, and volume.

Save and load allows you to start from previously generated populations.

Play starts playing each of the sound effects incrementally from top left to bottom right. Each sound effect can also be played seperately.

Reset completely restarts the process, starting from scratch. A warning will show before confirmation. Reset is also useful for getting a different starting point if the current one is poor.

Retry will bring you back to your previous population; useful if you weren't satisfied with the results and would like to go back and try again.

Next clears the selection and presents new candidates in the current population. Prev brings you back to the previous ones. The population is sorted from highest to lowest according to their fitness (how well they match your preferences).

Mutation rate and size modifies the randomness of the process. Smaller values make generated sounds less varied and vice versa.

Status at the bottom shows the current status of the system.

As the volume can become pretty loud, I would recommend not turning it up too much.

When you are satisfied with a sound effect, you can export it as a .wav file on the computer.
